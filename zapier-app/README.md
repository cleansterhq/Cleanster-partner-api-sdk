## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- A Cleanster Partner API key (find it in your Cleanster dashboard under **Settings → API**)
- A Zapier account (free or paid)
- Zapier CLI: `npm install -g zapier-platform-cli`

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd zapier-app
npm install
```

### 2. Log in to Zapier

```bash
zapier login
```

### 3. Register the app (first time only)

```bash
zapier register "Cleanster Partner API"
```

This will create your app on Zapier's developer platform and update `.zapierapprc` with your app ID.

### 4. Push the app to Zapier

```bash
zapier push
```

### 5. Test in Zapier

After pushing, go to [zapier.com](https://zapier.com), create a new Zap, and search for **Cleanster Partner API** to find your app.

---

## Authentication

This app uses **API Key** authentication (Bearer token).

When a user connects to Cleanster in Zapier, they will be asked for their **API Key**. The key is validated against `GET /v1/services`.

In your code, the API key is automatically added to every request as:
```
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
```

## Adding Webhooks (Future Enhancement)

The current implementation uses **polling** (checking for new data every 15 minutes on free Zapier plans, every 1–2 minutes on paid plans). For real-time triggers, the Cleanster API supports webhooks.

To convert a polling trigger to a webhook trigger:

```js
// In any trigger file, change:
operation: {
  type: "polling",
  perform: getBookings,
}

// To:
operation: {
  type: "hook",
  performSubscribe: subscribeHook,   // POST /v1/webhooks
  performUnsubscribe: unsubscribeHook, // DELETE /v1/webhooks/:id
  perform: parseWebhookPayload,
}
```

See the [Zapier Platform Docs - REST Hooks](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md#rest-hooks) for details.

---

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are needed. Authentication is entirely user-provided through Zapier's auth flow.

For local testing, you can create a `.env` file:

```env
CLEANSTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

And reference it in tests:
```js
const TEST_API_KEY = process.env.CLEANSTER_API_KEY;
```

---

## Publishing to Zapier App Directory

To make this integration available to all Zapier users (not just your own account):

1. Push a stable version: `zapier push`
2. Promote to production: `zapier promote <version>`
3. Submit for review via the [Zapier Developer Platform](https://developer.zapier.com)

Zapier reviews take 1–4 weeks. During review, ensure:
- All triggers have working `sample` data
- All actions have clear `helpText` on every field
- Authentication test endpoint returns a 200
- App description follows Zapier's style guidelines
